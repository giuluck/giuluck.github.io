Welcome to my website.

I am a **post-doc researcher** at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Bologna.

I mainly work on **Constrained Machine Learning** applied to **Algorithmic Fairness**, with a PhD dissertation titled
“Detection and Enforcement of Non-Linear Correlations for Fair and Robust Machine Learning Applications”, but I also
explored other areas of Artificial Intelligence, such as music generation models and decision-focused learning for
combinatorial optimization problems.
